# Timber

Timberman is a simple game where a man chops down a tree while dodging branches coming down. It could be a game to pass time or play with friends. The program is written in C++ and uses the SFML interface.

I created this game while learning about SFML and how to create a game with visuals. I really enjoy creating things and wanted to create a game that was beyond text base, which this program achieved.
